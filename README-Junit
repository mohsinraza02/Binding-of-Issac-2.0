How to Run testing

Text based Junit:
  1) Take all code from textCode;
  2) run the 'test' files;
  
  Only logic based files have Junit tests.
  
 GUI based test:
  No Junit, but here are the some play tests we did
  1)New game should spawn the player in the bottom left corner in the bottom left room;
  2)Load game should load the player and all items in the locations they were in from last save;
  3)Usable items add stats to the right stat and the right value and timer decreses;
  4)Collectable items are added to the backpack;
  5)Payer is stopped by black walls;
  6)when timer is 0.0 battle starts;
  7)Attack - will damage the boss(boss health updates), Boss attacks back(Player health updates)
  8)Item - will take an item and give the player 10 health(we fixed it)
  9)Skill -Breath, lowers boss defence, next attack will do more damage
          -Stretch, the player health will increase
          -Cry, the boss attack should decreas on the next boss attack
          -Cheat, player attack boss with an attck that does more damage then a normal attack
  10)When Player or Boss health is >=0 the game should end
